# Migrate AngularJS to Vue

Install the dependencies.
```sh
npm i
```

Launch development server:
```sh
npm start
```

Build
```sh
npm run build
```

## Stage 2

We have created a simple Vuejs app with a route to an /about page. The part of the angular app div containers in the index.html file has been commented, leaving only the container for the Vue application. So basically just running a Vuejs app at the moment.
